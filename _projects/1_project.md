Using data drawn from a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized study conducted by Fitzgerald et al.<sup>1</sup>, data anlysis was conducted to determine the best biomarker for indicating recent cannibis use. 

Files containing the raw data has been omitted, as the data is not publically available. As a result, the rmd file will not run as intended, and is only included for reference only.
