Some visualizations I created for GLOCAL's C-Dem project. Link to my repository is [here](https://github.com/zrrainer/Cdem?tab=readme-ov-file). The final report is posted on [GLOCAL'S website](https://glocalfoundation.ca/reports).

[GLOCAL](https://glocalfoundation.ca/) is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization that is committed to domestic engagement and global awareness. We are an official partner of the [Consortium on Electoral Democracy/ Consortium de la démocratie électorale (C-Dem)](https://c-dem.ca/), a research network across Canada that addresses urgent questions about political engagement, underrepresentation, levels of government, the evolution of public opinion between and across elections, and data collection practices with an evidence-based, cooperative approach to studying electoral democracy, during federal elections as well as subnationally and between elections.

This project comes in the form of a written report, aiming to explore and present finding in regards to [C-DEM’s 2021 Canadian Election Study Data](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/MMXTFC).
