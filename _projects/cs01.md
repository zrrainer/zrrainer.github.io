title: Biomarkers for Recent Cannibis Use
description: A case study
img: assets/img/cs01_cover.jpg
---
he data we will be using comes from a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized study published by Hoffman et. al. (2021). In the study, volunteers were randomly assigned to smoke a ciggertte containing placebo (0.02%), or 5.9% (low dose) or 13.4% (high dose) THC. Samples of whole blood (WB), oral fluid(OF), breath (BR) are taken before and after smoking. This report aims to determine the most effective and accurate biomarker for recent (3h) cannibis use. 

This is a group report written as a assignment for my UCSD COGS 108 Practical Data Sicence in R course. The co-authors are Eddie Ho and Derek Nguyen. The code for the full report can be found [here](https://github.com/zrrainer/cannibis-biomarker-case-study/tree/main), this markdown file is more of a brief overview. 


After some wrangling, a quick EDA plotting measurements over time, such as these ones:

Now we needed something to quantify how well a given cutoff works for any specific biomarker. With a helper function that takes in a cutoff as a parameter and return that cutoff's sensitivity (true positives / (total # of observations)) and specificity (true negatives / (total # of observations)), we can then visualize the effectiveness of every possible cutoff. 

tdlr: we want a cutoff with **high sensitivity** and **high specificity**. 

<div class="col-sm">
#calculate sensiticity and specificity for each cutoff of each biomarker
output_WB <- map_dfr(compounds_WB,
                     ~ sens_spec_cpd(
                       dataset = WB,
                       cpd = all_of(.x),
                       timepoints =  timepoints_WB
                     )) |> clean_gluc()

output_BR <- map_dfr(compounds_BR, 
                     ~ sens_spec_cpd(
                       dataset = BR,
                       cpd = all_of(.x),
                       timepoints = timepoints_BR
                     ))  |> clean_gluc()

output_OF <- map_dfr(compounds_OF,
                     ~ sens_spec_cpd(
                       dataset = OF,
                       cpd = all_of(.x),
                       timepoints = timepoints_OF
                     ))  |> clean_gluc()

Here we see the sensitivity of every possible cutoff at different time windows. We as a team decided that the cutoffs should be judged upon their average sensiticity and specificity. (Although, in hindsight, it might've been a good idea to base our analysis solely on the ealier time windows - we are trying to detect *recent* canibis use after all.) Plotting the average sensitivity and specificity of each cutoff, we get:

Whole blood:
![](_projects\cs01assets\avgSS.png)
Oral fluid:
![](_projects\cs01assets\avgSSOF.png)
Breath:
![](_projects\cs01assets\avgSSBR.png)

It should be apparent that OF-THC and WB-THC are the superior choices. The average sensitivity and specificity intersects at some cutoffs, meaning at that point, both the sensitivity and specificity is maximized. Additionally, if we eye ball their point of intersection, OF-THC has a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity at that point, making it the most optimal biomarker. 

Now we investigate OF-THC further to find the specific cutoff. In short, we basically zoom in on the graph. Giving us:

- and the specific detection limit:

  At the cutoff range of 0.82 to 0.90, the difference between the average sensitivity and average specificity is minimized. We will settle with **>0.85ng/mL of THC in oral fluid** sample as the final detection limit.
