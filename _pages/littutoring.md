About me:

A published writer and local university student who grew up in love with pure math and literature. Rainer is currently taking a break from their Bachelor's degree at University of California, San Diego, majoring in cognitive science with a machine learning specialization.

Rainer has been a reader ever since they started going through their grandma's bookshelf at the age of 7, and a writer since 10. To them, learning to read and appreciate literature is learning to be human. The test scores and grades will come effortlessly when you fall in love with the books you're reading - they become the least of your concerns. Great books will speak to you for the rest of your life. 

They have been published by Bright Flash Literary Review.
