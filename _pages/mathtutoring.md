About me:
  
Your local university student who grew up in love with pure math and literature. I am currently taking a gap year from my Bachelor's degree at University of California, San Diego, majoring in cognitive science with a machine learning specialization.

Ever since elementary, I've taught math to peers and aced every single math class, including getting the highest score possible on my AP Calculus BC exam. From what I've observed, the reason why most kids struggle in math class is because the lack of intuition - they were taught to do the math without the understanding on how or why anything works. With the proper intuition, math ceases to be about repetitive and confusing formulas, and instead become so glaringly obvious. I am here to teach the intuition that always helped me look at a concept in math and think: "isn't that just common sense?"
