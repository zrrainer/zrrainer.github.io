About me:

Your local university student who grew up in love with pure math and literature. I am currently taking a gap year from my Bachelor's degree at University of California, San Diego, majoring in cognitive science with a machine learning specialization.

I've been a reader ever since I started going through my grandma's bookshelf at the age of 7, and a writer since 10. To me, learning to read and appreciate literature is learning to be human. The test scores and grades will come effortlessly when you fall in love with the books you're reading - they become the least of your concerns. Great books will speak to you for the rest of your life. I am just here to show you the beauty within them that you haven't had a chance to meet.
